This module demonstrates how to customize the serialization mechanism from the default java serialization to the GemFire `DataSerializable` mechanism.

We basically serialize `Customer` objects, which have child `Address` objects.  Note how both implement the `DataSerializable` interface with implementations of the `fromData()` and `toData()` methods.

Experiment with implementation by:

- starting a cluster (see cluster folder and start script), 
- running the `SimpleClientWriter` to persist a customer to GemFire, and finally 
- reading it back with the `SimpleClientReader` program.
